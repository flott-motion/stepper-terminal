# Stepper Terminal

## About

Allows you to control a stepper motor from your PC via a CLI app that sends
commands to a firmware application running on an [LPC845-BRK] development board.

The firmware application uses the [Stepper] library to control the motor. It is
intended to serve as a testbed and usage example for Stepper. This project and
Stepper are part of [Flott], an open source toolkit for motion control software
in Rust.

## Status

This project is usable, but doesn't yet expose all of the features of Stepper.
Check out the
[list of issues](https://github.com/flott-motion/stepper-terminal/issues) for
some documented limitations. Help in filling the gaps is very welcome!

## Usage

### Set up the hardware

You need the following hardware:

- Full-size breadboard
- [LPC845-BRK] development board
- [STSPIN220 Stepper Motor Driver Carrier](https://www.pololu.com/product/2876)
- Matching stepper motor ([example](https://www.pololu.com/product/1208))
- Power supply (1.8V - 10V, depending on the motor)
- Jumper wires to make the connections

Then make the following connections:

|  LPC845-BRK |  STSPIN220 | Motor | Power |
| ----------: | ---------: | ----: | ----: |
| 1 - PIO0_16 |       STBY |       |       |
| 2 - PIO0_17 |      MODE1 |       |       |
| 3 - PIO0_18 |      MODE2 |       |       |
| 4 - PIO0_19 | STEP/MODE3 |       |       |
| 5 - PIO0_20 |  DIR/MODE4 |       |       |
|    20 - GND |        GND |       |       |
|    50 - VDD |        VCC |       |       |
|             |         A1 |    A1 |       |
|             |         A2 |    A2 |       |
|             |         B2 |    B2 |       |
|             |         B1 |    B1 |       |
|             |        GND |       |     - |
|             |       VMOT |       |     + |

### Flash the firmware

From the repository root, execute:

```bash
cd firmware
cargo embed
```

Assuming you have [cargo-embed](https://github.com/probe-rs/cargo-embed)
installed, and an LPC845-BRK is connected via USB, this should flash and run the
firmware, as well as open an RTT terminal with some log output.

### Run the CLI

From the repository root, execute:

```bash
cd cli
cargo run -- move-to 2000
```

This should move the motor by 2000 steps, using a nice acceleration ramp. Please
note that the argument specifies an absolute position, so executing the same
command again will not result in any movement (the motor already is at step
2000).

You can learn more about the command-line interface using `--help`:

```bash
cargo run -- --help
```

You can also use `--help` on specific subcommands:

```bash
cargo run -- move-to --help
```
